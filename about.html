      <h1>About News Café</h1>
      <p>
        News Café is more than just a coffee spot — it’s where stories are shared, friendships are brewed, and moments become memories.

  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    News Café was born from a simple yet powerful idea: to craft a place where people can gather, share stories, and enjoy more than just a cup of coffee. What began as a single neighborhood café has since evolved into a celebrated destination known for its signature vibe — a perfect blend of culture, flavor, and connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the beginning, we’ve focused on creating spaces that feel like a second home. Our founders believed that cafés should be more than transactional spaces — they should be cultural landmarks where good food and meaningful conversations thrive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years, we’ve grown alongside our community — listening, evolving, and expanding our offerings. We’ve introduced seasonal menus, hosted local artists, supported start-ups, and partnered with sustainability-driven suppliers. Each chapter in our journey has been shaped by the people who walk through our doors and leave with a story of their own.
