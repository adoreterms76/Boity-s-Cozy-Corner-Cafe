        There’s something magical about a perfectly made latte. The warmth of the cup in your hands, the rich aroma of espresso, and that velvety texture of steamed milk—it’s a ritual, a comfort, and an art.
      </p>

      <p>
        At News Café, every latte is crafted with intention. It starts with quality beans—locally sourced, ethically grown, and freshly roasted. Our baristas are trained to balance the espresso shot to bring out its subtle chocolate and nutty notes, with just the right touch of bitterness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then comes the steam. The milk is heated to the perfect temperature (between 60–65°C), creating a creamy microfoam that blends smoothly with the espresso. And for those who love visuals as much as taste—latte art. Hearts, ferns, tulips—you’ll find our team swirling up beautiful designs that turn each cup into a canvas.
      </p>

      <p>
        But more than technique, a great latte is about love. Love for the craft. Love for our community. And love for the simple pleasure of slowing down and enjoying a good cup of coffee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next time you visit News Café, take a sip and savor the details. We’re not just pouring coffee. We’re pouring warmth, care, and a little bit of artistry into every cup.
